                                <p>Currently there are some websites that offer tourism service to customers. These websites have pre-defined tour plans which the customers have to buy as it is. The problem is that they cannot customize their own trip and they have to travel according to the pre-defined plan. If they want to plan any trip on their own then they do not have any option available other than that they have to personally visit a tour planner. Here the problem arises because they cannot bargain much with that planner or that planner may have limited resources.
                                </p>
                                <p>
